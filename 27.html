    <h1>Text Typefaces</h1>
<p>Traditionally, text is composed to create a readable,
 coherent, and visually satisfying typeface that
 works invisibly, without the awareness of the reader.
 Even distribution of typeset material, with a minimum
  of distractions and anomalies, is aimed at producing
   clarity and transparency.</p>
<h2>Color</h2>
<p>In typesetting, color is the overall density
of the ink on the page, determined mainly by
the typeface, but also by the word spacing,
leading, and depth of the margins. Text layout,
tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay
of text with the white space of the page in
combination with other graphic elements impart
a "feel" or "resonance" to the subject matter.</p>
<h2>Principles of the Typographic Craft</h2>
<p>Three fundamental aspects of
typography are legibility, readability, and aesthetics.
Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
are often used synonymously, typographically they are
 separate but related concepts. Legibility and
 readability tend to support aesthetic aspects of a
 product.</p>
